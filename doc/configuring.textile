title: Configuring the Playground
---

Vanity will work out of the box on a default configuration.  Assuming you're using Redis on localhost, post 6379, there's nothing special to do.

If you run a different setup, use the playground object to configure Vanity.  For example:

<pre>
Vanity.playground.redis = "redis.example.com"
</pre>

Configuration options are:

|_. name      |_. Is all about ...                    |_. Default      |
| connection  | Connection configuration              | 127.0.0.1:6379 |
| namespace   | Namespace for Redis keys              | vanity:1       |
| load_path   | Directory containing experiment files | experiments    |
| logger      | This should be obvious                | default/Rails  |
