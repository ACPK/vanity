title: Configuring the Playground
---

Vanity will work out of the box on a default configuration.  Assuming you're using Redis on localhost, post 6379, there's nothing special to do.

If you run a different setup, use the playground object to configure Vanity.  For example:

<pre>
Vanity.playground.host = "redis.local"
Vanity.playground.password = "supersecret"
</pre>
