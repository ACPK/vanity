h3(#building). Building From Source

To make life easier, the source distribution takes advantage of "RVM":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ and "Bundler":http://gembundler.com/ to test Vanity against multiple versions of Ruby and specific dependencies.

For example, to test Vanity with Ruby 1.9.2 you could:

<pre>
$ rvm 1.9.2@vanity
$ bundle install
$ rake test
</pre>

Before release, we're going to test Vanity against all the Ruby versions and all the back-ends listed in the Rakefile. Please help by running the entire test suite (@rake test:rubies@) when making pull requests. It will take a while to run the first time, as it installs all the dependencies, so please be patient.


h3(#doc). Documentation

Documentation is written in "Textile":http://redcloth.org/textile/writing-paragraph-text/, and converted to HTML using "Jekyll":http://jekyllrb.com/.

API reference is "RDoc":http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html, converted to HTML using "Yardoc":http://yardoc.org/. 

To build and view documentation:

<pre>
$ rake docs
$ open html/index.html
</pre>
